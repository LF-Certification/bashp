# Script: bashpp-gh
# Extension handler for downloading packages from GitHub releases.
#
# Description:
#   This script serves as an extension handler for bashpp to pull packages from GitHub releases.
#   When bashpp encounters a GitHub repository URL (gh:// prefix), it delegates the package
#   retrieval to this handler. The handler downloads the latest release asset, extracts the
#   specified include file, and installs it to the appropriate directory. It supports nested
#   package paths and maintains proper directory structure.
#
# Usage:
#   bashpp-gh <repository> <include>
#   Called automatically by bashpp when processing GitHub repository URLs
#
# Parameters:
#   repository - The GitHub repository in the format "owner/repo"
#   include    - The path to the file to include, in the format "package/function" or
#               "package/subpackage/function" for nested paths
#
# Outputs:
#   No direct output, but creates files in the cache directory and include directory.
#   Updates .gitignore if running within a git repository.
#
# Note:
#   Requires curl to be installed.
#   Requires either GH_TOKEN or GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable for GitHub API access.
#   Will create cache directories as needed at BASHP_CACHE_DIR, XDG_CACHE_HOME/bashp or
#   ~/.cache/bashp.
#   Supports nested package paths and maintains proper directory structure.
#   Git integration has been improved to handle nested paths correctly.
