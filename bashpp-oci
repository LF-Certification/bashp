# bashpp-oci
# Extension handler for downloading packages from OCI container images.
#
# Description:
#   This script serves as an extension handler for bashpp to pull packages from OCI container
#   images. When bashpp encounters an OCI repository URL (default or oci:// prefix), it delegates
#   the package retrieval to this handler. The handler pulls the package, extracts the specified
#   include file, and installs it to the appropriate directory. It supports nested package paths
#   and maintains proper directory structure.
#
# Usage:
#   bashpp-oci <repository> <include>
#   Called automatically by bashpp when processing OCI repository URLs
#
# Parameters:
#   repository - The OCI repository containing the package image
#   include    - The path to the file to include, in the format "package/function" or
#               "package/subpackage/function" for nested paths
#
# Outputs:
#   No direct output, but creates files in the include directory and updates .gitignore
#   if running within a git repository.
#
# Note:
#   Requires an OCI client (docker by default) to be installed.
#   The OCI client can be configured using the OCI_CLIENT environment variable.
#   The image is expected to be tagged as 'latest' and follow the naming convention
#   'repository/bashp-package:latest'.
#   Supports nested package paths and maintains proper directory structure.
#   Git integration has been improved to handle nested paths correctly.
