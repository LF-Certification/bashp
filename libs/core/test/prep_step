# core::test::prep_step
# Executes a preparational step and reports success/failure with distinct formatting.
#
# Description:
#   This function executes a command intended for test setup/preparation (e.g., creating users,
#   setting up files, etc.). Unlike assertions, preparational steps are not test validations
#   themselves, but are necessary for the test to run. Failures are reported with a distinct
#   visual indicator to differentiate them from assertion failures.
#
# Usage:
#   core::test::prep_step <command> [args...]
#
# Parameters:
#   command - The command or function to execute.
#   args... - Optional arguments to pass to the command.
#
# Returns:
#   Returns 0 if the command succeeds, non-zero if it fails.
#
# Example:
#   core::test::prep_step useradd -m testuser
#   core::test::prep_step sudo mkdir -p /tmp/testdir
