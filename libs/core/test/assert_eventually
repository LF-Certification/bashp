# core::test::assert_eventually
# Asserts that a condition becomes true by retrying a command until it succeeds or times out.
#
# Description:
#   This function repeatedly executes a given command (with optional arguments)
#   until it succeeds (returns zero) or until the timeout expires.
#   This is useful for testing asynchronous operations or conditions that may become
#   true over time.
#   The function uses the `timeout` command to ensure the actual wait time matches
#   the specified timeout in seconds, rather than timing out in the middle of retries.
#
# Usage:
#   core::test::assert_eventually [timeout] <command> [args...]
#
# Parameters:
#   timeout - Optional. Timeout in seconds (default: 5).
#   command - The command or function to execute.
#   args... - Optional arguments to pass to the command.
#
# Example:
#   core::test::assert_eventually 10 test -f /tmp/file
function core::test::assert_eventually() {
  local timeout=${timeout:-}

  if [[ -z "$timeout" && -n "$1" && "$1" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    timeout=$1
    shift
  elif [[ -z "$timeout" ]]; then
    timeout=5
  fi

  if timeout "${timeout}" bash -s -- "$@" <<'EOF' &>/dev/null; then
until "$@"; do
  sleep 1
done
EOF
    echo "✅ Eventually succeeded: $*"
    return 0
  else
    echo "⛔ Eventually failed: '$*' failed after ${timeout}s" >&2
    return 1
  fi
}
