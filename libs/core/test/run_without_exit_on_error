# core::test::run_without_exit_on_error
# Executes a command with 'set -e' and 'set -u' temporarily disabled, then restores the original state.
#
# Description:
#   This helper function temporarily disables the 'set -e' (errexit) and 'set -u' (nounset)
#   shell options before executing a command, allowing the command to return any exit code
#   and reference undefined variables without causing the shell to exit. After execution,
#   it restores the original shell option states and outputs the exit code to stdout.
#   The function itself always returns 0 to prevent triggering 'set -e'.
#   This is particularly useful in test assertions that need to capture and validate
#   specific exit codes.
#
# Usage:
#   exitCode=$(core::test::run_without_exit_on_error <command> [args...])
#
# Parameters:
#   command - The command or function to execute.
#   args... - Optional arguments to pass to the command.
#
# Outputs:
#   The exit code of the executed command (to stdout).
#
# Example:
#   exitCode=$(core::test::run_without_exit_on_error some_command arg1 arg2)
