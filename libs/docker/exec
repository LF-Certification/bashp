# docker::exec
# Executes a command or script in a running Docker container.
#
# Description:
#   This function allows the execution of a bash shell or multiline command/script within a
#   specified Docker container. It is particularly useful for interactive debugging or running
#   complex scripts directly within the container's environment.
#   The function supports enabling bash's xtrace option if it is set in the calling environment,
#   which aids in debugging by showing commands as they are executed.
#   Commands or scripts are read from standard input, making it convenient to execute multiple
#   commands or entire scripts interactively or passed from a script.
#
# Usage:
#   echo "command_to_run" | docker::exec <container_name>
#   cat script.sh | docker::exec <container_name>
#
# Parameters:
#   container_name - The name or ID of the Docker container in which the command or script will be executed.
#
# Outputs:
#   Outputs of the executed commands or scripts.
#
# Note:
#   The function checks if the xtrace option is enabled and passes the '-x' argument to bash if true.
#   This allows for detailed command tracing when debugging complex operations within the container.
