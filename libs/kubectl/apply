# kubectl::apply
# Applies a Kubernetes manifest from STDIN and saves it to a specified file.
#
# Description:
#   This function reads a Kubernetes manifest from standard input, saves it to the specified file
#   path, and then applies the manifest using 'kubectl apply -f -'. It ensures that the file
#   ownership matches that of the parent directory of the provided path using the
#   file::inherit_owners function.
#
# Usage:
#   kubectl::apply <path>
#
# Parameters:
#   path - The file path where the Kubernetes configuration from stdin will be saved and then
#          applied.
#
# Outputs:
#   Outputs the result of the 'kubectl apply' command to stdout. The Kubernetes manifest is also
#   written to the specified file path.
#
# Note:
#   This function requires that the input path is provided and will exit with an error if it is
#   not.
#   The Kubernetes manifest must be piped into this function for it to be applied.
