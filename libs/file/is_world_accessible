# shellcheck shell=bash

# file::is_world_accessible
# Checks if a file or directory is world-readable and executable.
#
# Description:
#   This function checks if the specified file or directory, and all its parent directories up to
#   '/', are world-readable and executable. It is particularly useful for verifying if a file or
#   directory can be accessed by any user on the system. For files, it checks if the file is
#   world-readable. For directories, it checks if they are world-readable and executable. It
#   iteratively performs these checks up the directory tree to ensure full path accessibility.
#
# Usage:
#   file::is_world_accessible <path>
#
# Parameters:
#   path - The path to the file or directory to check.
#
# Returns:
#   Exits with status 0 (true) if the file or directory and all parent directories are 
#   world-readable and executable. Exits with status 1 if a file is not world-readable, or with
#   status 2 if a directory (or any parent directory) is not world-readable and executable.
