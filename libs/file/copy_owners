# file::copy_owners
# Copies the owner and group permissions from a source file or directory to a destination.
#
# Description:
#   This function uses the 'stat' command to retrieve the user and group ownership of a source file
#   or directory and applies the same ownership to the destination file or directory using the
#   'chown' command. It supports an optional recursive operation to apply ownership changes to all
#   files and directories within the source if it is a directory.
#
# Usage:
#   file::copy_owners <source> <destination> [recursive]
#
# Parameters:
#   source: The source file or directory whose ownership is to be copied.
#   destination: The destination file or directory where the ownership will be applied.
#   recursive: Optional. If set to 'true', the ownership change will be applied recursively.
#              Default is 'false'.
#
# Outputs:
#   None. Changes are applied directly to the filesystem.
#
# Note:
#   This function requires that the 'stat' and 'chown' commands are available in the environment
#   where the script is run. Additionally, it requires sudo privileges to change ownership, which
#   means the user must have the appropriate permissions to execute sudo commands.
