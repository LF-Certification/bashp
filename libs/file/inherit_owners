# file::inherit_owners
# Inherits ownership from the parent directory to the specified path.
#
# Description:
#   This function sets the owner and group of the specified path to match its parent directory.
#   It is useful for ensuring that files or directories created within a certain directory inherit
#   the ownership properties of their parent directory, maintaining consistent permissions and
#   ownership across directory structures.
#
# Usage:
#   file::inherit_owners <path>
#
# Parameters:
#   path - The file or directory path whose ownership should be set to match its parent directory.
#
# Outputs:
#   None.
#
# Note:
#   This function relies on the 'file::copy_owners' function to perform the actual ownership copying.
