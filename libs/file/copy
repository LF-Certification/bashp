# file::copy
# Copies files or directories from a source to a destination and inherits ownership.
#
# Description:
#   This function copies files or directories from a specified source to a destination.
#   After copying, it ensures that the copied items inherit the ownership properties
#   of their new parent directory using the 'file::inherit_owners' function.
#
# Usage:
#   file::copy <source> <destination> [additional cp arguments]
#
# Parameters:
#   source - The source path from which files or directories are copied.
#   destination - The destination path to which files or directories are copied.
#   additional cp arguments - Optional additional arguments that are passed directly to the 'cp'
#                             command.
#
# Outputs:
#   Outputs of the 'cp' command showing what was copied, followed by the inheritance of ownership
#   to the new files.
#
# Example:
#   file::copy /path/to/source /path/to/destination -r
#
# Note:
#   This function uses 'cp' command for copying and handles complex scenarios where additional arguments might be needed.
#   It parses the output of 'cp' to apply ownership settings correctly.
