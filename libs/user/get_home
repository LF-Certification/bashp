#   username - The username whose home directory is to be retrieved. Optional, defaults to the
#              current user.

# Outputs:
#   The home directory of the specified or default user.
#
# Example:
#   user::get_home "exampleUser"  # Outputs the home directory of 'exampleUser'
#   user::get_home                # Outputs the home directory of the current user
function user::get_home() {
  local username=${1:-${user:-$(whoami)}}
  getent passwd "$username" | cut -d: -f6
