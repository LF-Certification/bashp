# Description:
#   This function fetches the user ID (UID) of the user specified by the username argument.

#   user::get_uid <username>
#
# Parameters:
#   username - The username whose UID is to be retrieved. Optional, defaults to the current user.
#
# Outputs:
#   The user ID of the specified or default user.
#
# Example:
#   user::get_uid "exampleUser" # Outputs the UID of 'exampleUser'
#   user::get_uid               # Outputs the UID of the current user
function user::get_uid() {
  local username=${1:-${user:-$(whoami)}}
  getent passwd "$username" | cut -d: -f3
}
