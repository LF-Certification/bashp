#
# Description:
#   This function fetches the group ID (GID) of the user specified by the username argument.

#
# Usage:
#   user::get_gid <username>
#
# Parameters:
#   username - The username whose GID is to be retrieved. Optional, defaults to the current user.
#
# Outputs:
#   The group ID of the specified or default user.
#
# Example:
#   user::get_gid "exampleUser"  # Outputs the GID of 'exampleUser'
#   user::get_gid               # Outputs the GID of the current user
function user::get_gid() {
  local username=${1:-${user:-$(whoami)}}
  getent passwd "$username" | cut -d: -f4
}
