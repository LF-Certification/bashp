# Retrieves the login shell of a specified user.
#
# Description:
#   This function fetches the login shell of the user specified by the username argument.
#   If no username is provided, it defaults to the current user. This is useful for scripts
#   that need to interact with the user's shell environment or execute shell-specific commands.
#
# Usage:
#   user::get_shell <username>
#
# Parameters:
#   username - The username whose login shell is to be retrieved. Optional, defaults to the current
#              user.
#
# Outputs:
#   The login shell of the specified or default user.
#
# Example:
#   user::get_shell "exampleUser"  # Outputs the login shell of 'exampleUser'
#   user::get_shell                # Outputs the login shell of the current user
function user::get_shell() {
  local username=${1:-${user:-$(whoami)}}
  getent passwd "$username" | cut -d: -f7
}
